    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to the Flamme Rouge Scoreboard</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">
        This is an <strong>independent fan project</strong> created by a couple of friends who enjoy playing 
        <em>Flamme Rouge</em>. It is not affiliated with or commercially related to the official game.  
        We simply wanted a way to play <strong>multi-stage races</strong> and keep track of results more easily.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        In addition to the standard rules, we have come up with a few extra twists and house rules to make the game 
        even more exciting. You can read about these on the 
        <a href="{{ url_for('rules') }}" class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800">Rules page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What you'll find on the Rules page</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Assistant rider concept</li>
        <li>Time trial and team time trials</li>
        <li>“Good day / Bad day” rider condition</li>
        <li>Points systems for classement, sprints, and mountain sprints</li>
        <li>...and more house rules we’ve experimented with</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-6">
        Have fun exploring, and we hope this scoreboard helps bring your Flamme Rouge races to life!
    </p>
